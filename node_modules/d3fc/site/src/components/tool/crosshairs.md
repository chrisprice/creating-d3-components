The crosshair component renders an interactive crosshair. The component should be data-joined to an empty array which it will populate with an object that indicates the current crosshair location. This is a useful mechanism for displaying the crosshair location in some form of legend.

The crosshair is typically rendered alongside other series. The following example uses a multi-series component to render a crosshair and a line series:

```js
{{{example-code}}}
```

Which gives the following:

{{>example-fixture}}

You can control the snapping behaviour of the crosshair by supplying a snapping function to the `snap` property. A number of snap functions are [supplied as part of the library]({{package.repository.url}}/blob/master/src/util/snap.js).

You can configure X and Y labels via the `xLabel` and `yLabel` properties. The following example formats the Y value to 2 decimal places:

```js
var crosshairs = fc.tool.crosshair()
  .yLabel(function(d) { return d3.format('.2f')(d.datum.close); });
```

The crosshair emits 'trackingstart', 'trackingmove' and 'trackingend' events which can be used to add further interactively. You can also modify the crosshair UI via the `decorate` property.
