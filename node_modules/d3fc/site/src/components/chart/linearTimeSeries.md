The linear time series is a 'top level' d3fc component that has been assembled from a number of other smaller components. The linear time series has a date time x-axis and a linear y-axis, with the domain, ticks and other properties re-bound so that they are exposed on the linear time series chart directly.

The chart has a `plotArea` property which is used to supply the series, or any other component that is rendered within the plot area.

The following is a complete example which renders a few different series types:

```js
{{{example-code}}}
```

Note that the chart is responsible for setting the `xScale` and `yScale` properties of the items added to the `plotArea`. In this case a multi-series is added, which multiplexes these values.

Here is what the rendered chart looks like:

<div id="linear-time-series" class="chart"> </div>
<script type="text/javascript">
(function() {
  {{{example-code}}}
}());
</script>
